# Project Management

## Project Charter

Developing the Project Charter is the process of developing a document that formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. The key benefits of this process are that it provides a direct link between the project and the strategic objectives of the organization, creates a formal record of the project, and shows the organizational commitment to the project (PYMBOK 6th ed).

This happens at the Initiation phase of a project. The inputs of which are:

- Business Case
- Feasibility Study
- EEFs
- OPAs like org structure, market conditions and processes and governance frameworks respectively.

So, to ensure the Project Charter (the output) of the Initiation Phase is correct, we must ensure that the input contains the correct information, that is valid, current, and contextually appropriate.

If the BC is weak or incomplete the Charter will lack justification. Unused OPAs and you might end up reinventing the wheel or missing compliance. Ignoring EEFs, and you risk regulatory violations and missed constraints. Basically, garbage is in, garbage out.

To the second part of this question: Unfortunately, there is no guarantee a project will be accepted upon completion. Just because it has a solid business case or has passed a feasibility study. Stakeholder satisfaction and sponsor buy-in are dynamic, not static. You can control clarity, but you cannot control acceptance. All you can do is give the Charter its best chance. And this is by ensuring the inputs are good. Involve stakeholders early and often. Tie business objectives to deliverables. Baseline the scope and manage changes. Formal Sign-Off Process and lastly use a residual risk and exit strategy. You can add a project termination clause in your charter or agreement. Document, document, document.

### Exclusions

Exclusions exist to set boundaries and prevent scope creep. It was more helpful to enumerate what the application was not meant to do. By making a list of exclusions, by setting boundaries, you focus on the scope of the project and hopefully increased the likelihood that it would succeed.

Exclusions help manage expectations by eliminating assumptions and preventing any doubts about responsibilities or deliverables. If the leadership has a clear understanding of the limits, they can better decide on whether the project should move forward or not move forward.

This does not mean the exclusions should be exhaustive. It should be focused, minimal and most importantly it should be strategic. The goal is to prevent misunderstanding or misalignment. What we want to avoid is to slow acceptance.

## Project Management Plan

The project management plan is a comprehensive, formal document that outlines how a project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. It integrates and consolidates subsidiary management plans and baselines, serving as the authoritative guide for managing the project across its lifecycle. The Project Management Plan is created during the Planning Phase of the project lifecycle. Specifically, in terms of the PMBOK® Guide (6th Edition), it is the primary output of the process.

The development of this plan requires several key inputs. These include:

- `The Project Charter`: Which formally authorizes the project and outlines its high-level objectives and constraints.
- Also essential are the outputs from other planning processes, such as `scope`, `schedule`, and `risk management plans`, which collectively form the foundation of the consolidated project management plan.
- Additionally, the process draws upon `Enterprise Environmental Factors` (EEFs)—such as `organizational culture`, `industry standards`, and `infrastructure—and Organizational Process Assets` (OPAs), including internal policies, templates, and historical lessons learned.

To assemble the plan, the project manager employs various tools and techniques, including expert judgment, data gathering methods like brainstorming, interpersonal and team skills (such as conflict resolution and facilitation), and structured meetings to ensure alignment and completeness.

The final output is the comprehensive Project Management Plan—a formal, approved document that defines how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. It integrates more than ten subsidiary management plans (such as scope, schedule, cost, and risk) and includes three major performance baselines (scope, schedule, and cost). Additional components may include the change management plan, configuration management plan, and other supporting documentation.

In summary, the development of the Project Management Plan occurs during the Planning Phase, under the "Develop Project Management Plan" process. Its inputs include the Project Charter, planning outputs, EEFs, and OPAs. The output is the Project Management Plan itself, which serves as a central, guiding document for all subsequent execution, monitoring, and control activities throughout the project lifecycle.

> According to PMBOK® Guide 6th Edition, the inputs for the Develop Project Management Plan process include:
> Project Charter – Authorizes the project and provides high-level objectives and constraints.
> Outputs from Other Planning Processes – All subsidiary plans and baselines developed during planning (e.g., scope plan, schedule plan, risk plan).
> Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs) – Organizational culture, regulations, systems, infrastructure, etc.
> Organizational Process Assets (OPAs) – Policies, procedures, templates, lessons learned, etc.

## Key Components of a Project Management Plan

### Project Scope Management Plan

Defines how the scope will be defined, validated, and controlled.
Helps prevent scope creep by aligning the team on deliverables and boundaries.

### Schedule Management Plan

Establishes how the schedule will be developed, managed, and reported.
Provides timelines, milestones, and sequencing, essential for coordinating tasks and resources.

### Cost Management Plan

Outlines budget planning, funding, cost tracking, and control mechanisms.
Supports financial accountability and prioritization of resources.

### Quality Management Plan

Specifies quality objectives, standards, metrics, and assurance/control activities.
Ensures deliverables meet required standards and customer expectations.

### Resource Management Plan

Identifies roles, responsibilities, organizational charts, and staffing plans.
Clarifies who is doing what, avoiding role ambiguity and underutilization.

### Communication Management Plan

Details stakeholder communication needs, frequency, formats, and channels.
Ensures consistent information flow and stakeholder engagement.

### Risk Management Plan

Describes risk identification, analysis, response strategies, and tracking.
Proactively prepares the team for uncertainties, reducing disruption.

### Procurement Management Plan

Outlines how external resources, contracts, or services will be acquired.
Supports vendor management and delivery coordination.
Stakeholder Engagement Plan

Identifies key stakeholders, their interests, influence, and engagement strategies.
Enhances team collaboration and manages expectations.

### Change Management Plan

Defines the process for submitting, reviewing, and approving changes.
Maintains control over project scope, budget, and timeline.
Baseline Documents (often included or referenced):

> - Scope baseline (scope statement, WBS)
> - Schedule baseline (approved schedule)
> - Cost baseline (approved budget)

## How the Project Management Plan Supports Team Management

- `Alignment and Clarity:` Provides a single reference for team roles, expectations, deliverables, and timelines, eliminating confusion.

- `Decision-Making Framework:` Gives the project manager defined processes for handling changes, issues, and risks, leading to faster and more consistent decisions.

- `Performance Monitoring:` With baselines and tracking mechanisms, the manager can objectively assess progress and take corrective actions when necessary.

- `Accountability:` Clearly defined responsibilities and communication plans ensure everyone knows what they are accountable for and to whom.

- `Conflict Resolution:` Offers agreed-upon protocols and governance, which are critical for resolving disputes or misalignments constructively.

- `Change Control:` Prevents scope creep and project drift by enforcing disciplined change management, keeping the team focused.
